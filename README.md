ee2-treegetter
==============

EE2 Taxonomy Treegetter will, in instances where a channel is associated with only one Taxonomy tree, return the ID of that tree. 

Example usage:
`{exp:taxonomy:breadcrumbs tree_id="{exp:treegetter segment="1" default_tree_id="5"}" entry_id="{entry_id}" delimiter="/"}`
